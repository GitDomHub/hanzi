# Hanzi Character Animation
The goal of this project was modernize the web-based animation of Hanzi strokes, used by Tufts Chinese Department in their intro level classes. The existing animation was Java based, requiring the installation of a plugin. This became a barrier for many students, preventing widespread use.
The new version is implemented entirely in HTML5, CSS, & Javascript, making it compatible with all modern browsers. Strokes are loaded from the database and the animations are created dynamically, allowing for any stroke to be represented. Each stroke is animated using CSS keyframe animations, which produce fast loading animations that appear smooth and fluid.
